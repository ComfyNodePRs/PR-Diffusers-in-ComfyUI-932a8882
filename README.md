# Diffusers-in-ComfyUI
This is a custom node allowing the use of the diffusers pipeline into ComfyUI. 

This work is greatly inspired by this [repository](https://github.com/Limitex/ComfyUI-Diffusers). I decided to recode it from scratch mainly for learning purposes, as well as because at first I only needed a portion of the code. As a result, there's a lot of Limitex' work used in this repo, and I thank them for this opportunity to learn!

Don't hesitate checking out Limitex' repo, it is much more complete than mine at this time.
