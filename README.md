# Diffusers-in-ComfyUI
This is a custom node allowing the use of the diffusers pipeline into ComfyUI. This work is greatly inspired by this [repository](https://github.com/Limitex/ComfyUI-Diffusers). I decided to recode it from scratch mainly for learning purposes, as well as because at first I only needed a portion of the code.

Don't hesitate checking out Limitex' work though.
